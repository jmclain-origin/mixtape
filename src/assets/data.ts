    comment: `ah
    Cradle of Filth, easily one of my favorite bands. I've always found
    their lyrical content to be very poetic. Which leaves room for
    interpretation. For me, this song speaks to three aspects of love
    that together represent an absolute love. The "real" love, to love
    the person's soul. The sexual love, to love the person's flesh. The eternal love, to love the person unconditionally to no end.`,

playlist/radio station that I find myself often listening to lately.
But for me it sets a mood, a genre you kinda got me hooked on and now
I've come to associate it with you. Either way it's chill, calming,
and relaxing and just reminds me of hanging out with you in our more
recent times.`;
