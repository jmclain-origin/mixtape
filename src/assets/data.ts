    comment: `ah
    Cradle of Filth, easily one of my favorite bands. I've always found
    their lyrical content to be very poetic. Which leaves room for
    interpretation. For me, this song speaks to three aspects of love
    that together represent an absolute love. The "real" love, to love
    the person's soul. The sexual love, to love the person's flesh. The eternal love, to love the person unconditionally to no end.`
